# 🌟 Git Branching Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines our branching strategy for the RFP Response Generator project to maintain code quality, enable parallel development, and ensure stable releases.

## 📋 Branch Structure

```
development (main development branch)
├── platformX-poc (stable POC branch)
└── feature branches
    ├── feature/enhanced-analytics
    ├── feature/bulk-processing  
    ├── feature/ui-improvements
    ├── feature/api-enhancements
    └── feature/performance-optimization
```

## 🎯 Branch Purposes

### `development`
- **Purpose**: Main development branch with stable, tested features
- **Protection**: Protected branch, requires PR reviews
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed to staging environment
- **Merges from**: Feature branches (via PR), `platformX-poc` (via PR)

### `platformX-poc`
- **Purpose**: Stable POC demonstrating core functionality
- **Protection**: Protected branch, limited direct commits
- **Deployment**: Production demos and client presentations
- **Merges from**: `development` for stable updates, tested feature branches

### `feature/*`
- **Purpose**: Individual feature development and experimentation
- **Naming**: `feature/description-of-feature`
- **Lifecycle**: Created from `development`, merged back via PR
- **Examples**: 
  - `feature/enhanced-analytics`
  - `feature/bulk-rfp-processing`
  - `feature/real-time-collaboration`

## 🚀 Workflow Process

### 1. Starting New Feature Development

```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout development

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin development

# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Start development
```

### 2. Feature Development

```bash
# Regular commits during development
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement feature component"

# Push to remote feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Testing & Integration

```bash
# Option A: Merge to POC for integration testing
git checkout platformX-poc
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Option B: Create PR to development for code review
# (Use GitHub/GitLab interface)
```

### 4. Merging Strategy

#### For Development Branch:
1. Create Pull Request from feature branch to `development`
2. Code review by team members
3. Run automated tests
4. Merge via PR (squash commits if needed)

#### For POC Updates:
1. Test feature thoroughly in isolation
2. Merge tested features to `platformX-poc`
3. Integration testing on POC branch
4. Demo preparation

## 📋 Branch Protection Rules

### `development` Branch
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Restrict pushes to administrators only
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date

### `platformX-poc` Branch  
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
- ✅ Restrict direct pushes
- ✅ Require administrator approval for sensitive changes

## 🏷️ Naming Conventions

### Feature Branches
- `feature/analytics-dashboard` - New analytics functionality
- `feature/bulk-processing` - Batch RFP processing
- `feature/ui-redesign` - UI/UX improvements
- `feature/api-v2` - API enhancements
- `feature/performance-optimization` - Performance improvements

### Hotfix Branches (if needed)
- `hotfix/critical-bug-fix` - Critical production fixes
- `hotfix/security-patch` - Security-related fixes

### Release Branches (future)
- `release/v1.0.0` - Release preparation
- `release/v1.1.0` - Minor version releases

## 🔄 Integration Timeline

### Weekly Cycle:
- **Monday**: Create new feature branches from latest `development`
- **Wednesday**: Mid-week sync, merge stable features to POC for testing
- **Friday**: Code review day, merge completed features to `development`

### Monthly Cycle:
- **Week 1-3**: Feature development and testing
- **Week 4**: Integration week, merge `development` to `platformX-poc`
- **Month end**: Stable POC ready for demos/presentations

## 📊 Current Active Branches

| Branch | Purpose | Status | Last Updated |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| `development` | Main dev branch | ✅ Active | Latest |
| `platformX-poc` | Stable POC | ✅ Active | Synced |
| `feature/enhanced-analytics` | Analytics dashboard | 🚧 In Development | Today |

## 🛠️ Tools & Automation

### Git Hooks
- Pre-commit: Code formatting, linting
- Pre-push: Run test suite
- Post-merge: Update dependencies

### CI/CD Integration
- Automatic testing on feature branch pushes
- Deployment to staging from `development`
- Production deployment from `platformX-poc`

## 📋 Best Practices

### Commit Messages
```
feat: add new analytics dashboard
fix: resolve RFP parsing issue
docs: update API documentation
test: add unit tests for vector store
refactor: optimize response generation
```

### Pull Request Guidelines
1. **Clear title**: Describe what the PR accomplishes
2. **Detailed description**: Explain changes and reasoning
3. **Link issues**: Reference related GitHub issues
4. **Screenshots**: Include UI changes visually
5. **Testing notes**: How to test the changes

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes without migration
- [ ] Performance impact considered

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### Critical Bug in POC
1. Create `hotfix/critical-issue` from `platformX-poc`
2. Fix the issue with minimal changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Merge directly to `platformX-poc`
5. Create PR to backport to `development`

### Rollback Scenario
1. Identify problematic commit
2. Create revert commit
3. Test revert thoroughly
4. Deploy via standard process
